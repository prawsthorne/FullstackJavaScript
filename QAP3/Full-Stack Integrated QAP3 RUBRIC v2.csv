,Complete with Distinction,5,Complete,4,Mostly Complete,3,Partially Complete,2,Incomplete,1
Designed and Implemented a database VIEW that fetches the data required by the chosen user story.,Database VIEW includes  Many-to-Many relationships that implemented the data features required by the user story. Field names and SQL structure aids in understandability and reuse.,,Database design includes one well designed database VIEW.,,Database design includes one database VIEW with poor field naming and structure.,,Database VIEW is only partially implemented.,,No database VIEW has been implemented or shows no understanding implementing a database VIEW.,

Created a well designed file naming and folder structure for a modular full stack application. ,"A file naming and folder structure fits with current design patterns for a modern full-stack application. File naming and folder structure aids in understandability and reuse.
",,A file naming and folder structure exists for a well designed modular full stack application.,,"A file naming and folder structure exists, but does not fit for a well designed modular full stack application.",,All files are in a single folder or the file naming and folder structure does not reflect a good designed modular full stack application.,,File naming is none existent or poor and confusing and folder structure is flat and does not help with project organization.,

"Developed a multi-file project which successfully implements a data access layer service, routes, and a user interface view. The modules use the correct NPM packages. The project successfully implements the features described in the user story.",Solution implements two or more of the QAP story options. The solution is well structured and the user interface is intuative. All functions have comments to explain functionality and have a section for revision history.,,"Multi-file project successfully implements a data access layer service, routes, and a user interface view. The preferred NPM modules successfully implement the features described in the user story. Code comments are terse.",,The solution mostly implements the features described in the user story. Code comments are terse or non-existent.,,The solution is incomplete and does not implement the features described in the user story. Code comments are terse or non-existent.,,The solution is not working. File and code modularization is non-existent.  Code is unmanageable.,

Well designed and correctly implemented DAL module for fetching data from the postgresql database VIEW.,DAL successfully implements multiple features into .js files enabling more than three different database queries. At least one DAL function accepts a parameter that is passed into the database query. The DAL functions are written in a way to promote reuse.,,DAL layer exists in project folder with node .js file dedicated to accessing the database. At least one function is correctly implemented to query the database. Database connection is implemented with a singleton pattern to facilitate database connection reuse.,,DAL function(s) successfully fetch data form the database. Code is poorly structured and the database connection is not implemented as a singleton.,,The DAL solution is incomplete and only partially (or not at all) fetches data from the PostgreSQL dvdrental database. Code is partially implemented.,,Data Access Layer (DAL) looks to have been attempted and is incomplete. Student was unable to implement a working DAL.,

Well designed and correctly implemented routes which control the logical flow of the application.,"Multiple routes have been implemented, with at least one parameter based route.",,A routes file has been implemented in node.js using the approach defined by Express. The route successfully implements the programmatic features expected by a MVC controller. The routes DAL service is correctly executed to fetch data for the route.,,Routes have mostly been implemented. Code is working but unorganized and the routes are not in a node.js file dedicated to the route. References of route to DAL service are poorly named and / or poorly organized.,,The implementation of routes have been attempted and are only partially working. Route does not execute the related DAL service.,,No routes have been implemented.,

Well designed and correctly implemented user inteface views programmed in html with embedded javascript (ejs).,User Interface also includes the use of CSS to improve and enhance the user experience. The user interface and menu system is easy to understand and improves usability.,,User interface (UI) correctly displays the data requested in the user story. The UI is well implemented in an html page that include embedded javascript (EJS) to render the dynamic database content. The UI is implemented as an MVC view that is controlled by the MVC controller (route).,,"The user interface is mostly complete, the use of embedded javascript (EJS) is working though the code is poorly structured and doesn't align well with the pages html. Dynamic data from the postgresql dvdrental database is displayed on the web page.",,User Interface is only partially complete by not implementing all the html and EJS to display the dynamic database content required by the user story.,,No UI views have been implemented.,

"QAP correctly handed in.
","All problem files are present within a single zip file as requested. Archived files are well named to ease evaluation of QAP. Items are very well organized enabling the instructor to assess completion in a quick and easy manner.
",,"All problem files are present within a single zip file as requested. Archived files are well named to ease evaluation of QAP. 
",,"Most problem files are present within a single zip file as requested. Archived files are named but difficult to assess each problems solution.
",,"Less than half of the problem files are present within a single zip file as requested, or multiple zip files were provided. Archived files are named, but difficult to assess each problems solution.
",,"Very difficult to assess QAP completion. Additional work is required.
